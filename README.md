### ðŸš€ About Me

- I'm currently a compuer science and engineering student who's curious to learn and apply everything that I can to create new things.
- I'm diving deep into **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**, with a strong foundation in **Python** and problem-solving.
- Exploring real-world applications in **IoT**, **smart systems**, and intelligent agents.
- Currently working on projects that bridge hardware and AI, like smart air quality systems and AI simulations.
